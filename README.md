# Investigation-of-the-Patient-Population-at-Bruner-Clinic
This is the repository for my practicum project for my Master's Degree in Data Science from Regis University in Denver, Colorado. The project will focus around the patient population at Bruner Clinic in Denver, Colorado. I will start by looking at some characteristic of patients coming in with some of the most common chronic conditions within the United States. I will also be building out some social determinants to see how these factors effect the health of these patients. Once my data is collected, I will run an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis finishing up with a cluster analysis with K-means and HCA unsupervised learning algorithms.
